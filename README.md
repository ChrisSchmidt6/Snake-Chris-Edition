# Snake-Chris-Edition
My own version of the classic Snake game which I created when I had extra time during my intro to comp sci class when I was a junior in high school

The "old" folder has the original version I made before my friends started asking for features to be added

"SPS" stands for "slithers per second" and just tracks the speed as there are bonus apples that will affect the speed

This can be played by downloading everything and opening "index.html"
